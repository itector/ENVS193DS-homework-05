Abstract:

The effect of prey availability on Sarracenia plants was shown by this data set using the variables amass, chlorophyll, totmass, num_phylls, num_lvl, species, sla, etc.

## Methodological Information

At Harvard Forest sarracenia pitcher plants were used to conduct a manipulative feeding experiment to test the relationship of morphological, physiological, and taxonomic variables. Each pitcher plant was examined and variables were measured. Prey availability was controlled and the other variables were examined for how they changed in relation to the prey availability changing.
